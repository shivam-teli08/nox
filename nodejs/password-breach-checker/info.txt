📌 Project Summary – Email Breach Checker (Node.js)

✅ Objective

A simple Node.js tool to check if a user's email has appeared in known data breaches, using local mock data.
🧩 Problem Statement

Most users don’t know if their emails are compromised. Existing tools often require internet, API keys, or paid access. This tool solves that problem locally and offline.

⚙️ Tech Used

🟢 Node.js
📤 `readline` (for CLI input)
🌐 `http` (basic server example)
📁 Local mock data (`require()` from a JS file)

---

 🔧 Features

✉️ Asks for user email via CLI
📂 Checks against local mock data
⚠️ Shows breached platforms and dates
✅ Shuts down server after response


🔑 APIs like HaveIBeenPwned need a paid API key
📡 Internet not required for this local tool
💸 Free and simple for learning Node.js
🧠 Focused on logic, not integration


 🚀 Possible Next Steps

🖥️ Add a frontend for user input
🔗 Convert it into an API endpoint
🌍 Use real breach-checking API
🛢️ Store breach data in a database
